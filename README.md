# DiscordMobilePlayingCLI

Discord currently only supports game activity on a mobile platform using Samsung Game Launcher, which is only available on Samsung devices.

DiscordMobilePlayingCLI is only a PoC that game activities can be implemented on another platform like jailbroken iOS, or another kind of android distros by using the Discord API. Well, you can't do anything about the "Playing on Samsung Galaxy" for now.
